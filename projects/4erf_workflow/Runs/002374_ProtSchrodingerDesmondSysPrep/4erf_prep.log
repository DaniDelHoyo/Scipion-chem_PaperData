Working on structure 1
Finding het groups...
Coloring atoms by element (green carbons in hets)...
Fixing common structure mistakes...
  No mistakes were found
Pre-treating metals...
Done treating metals
Assigning bond orders...
  Using CCD: True
CCD template assignment failed for HET "HSD " due to:
  CCD and het structures have different number of atoms.
  Falling back to bond order assignment based on geometry.
CCD template assignment failed for HET "HSD " due to:
  CCD and het structures have different number of atoms.
  Falling back to bond order assignment based on geometry.
  Assigned the following bonds (format: atom1, atom2, order): {(1269, 1270, 2), (914, 918, 2), (920, 921, 2), (1263, 1267, 2), (1264, 1266, 2), (915, 917, 2)}
