Virtual Drug Screening workflow example
---------------------------------------

Example shown in "Virtual Drug Screening workflow" section for 4ERF PDB structure. Contains the Scipion project
folder, which can be imported into the Scipion workflow engine and reproduced once all the necessary plugins are
installed.
The example can be divided into 4 subworkflows, which are examples of useful tasks discussed in the paper. The protocols
related to each of these subworkflows can be identified by their labels in the GUI, which have the form:

<Subworkflow number> ) <Plugin> - <Task performed>

Images are added in this document to localize the subworkflows, but note that the protocols might appear disordered.

These subworkflows are:

1) Main VDS workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Principal workflow that includes protocols following the "Virtual Drug Screening workflow" section:

.. figure:: images/subworkflow1.png
   :alt: vds workflow

1) **Molecules import**
    - **Receptor import**: 4ERF structure from PDB web, a ligase from Homo Sapiens
    - **Small molecules import**: 4 ZINC small molecule structures are imported from local "mol2" files
      (included in this repository).

2) **Molecules preparation**
    - **Receptor preparation**: we used LePro protein preparation (from LePhar) to prepare the receptor, removing
      the ligand included in the structure and other heteroatoms and extracting only chain A.
    - **Small molecules preparation**: we used OpenBabel ligand preparation in order to add charges to the imported
      small molecules and generating up to 2 conformers for each of them.

3) **Molecules filtering**
    - **Regions Of Interest definition**: set of protocols that tries to find the most promising regions of the
      receptor for interacting with the ligand. We did so by, first, independently predicting these receptor
      pockets with FPocket, P2Rank and AutoSite. Then, the results of each software are combined using the
      consensus protocol as explained in the paper.

4) **Docking**

   Prepared small molecules are docked onto the consensus ROIs. This task is performed independently using
   LeDock, AutoDock-GPU and Vina, with default parameters. Then, as explained in the paper, the results of
   these protocols are rescored using ODDT Vina and RFScore_v3. Finally, the rescored docking poses are
   combined and the most promising ones are extracted using the consensus protocol.

5) **Molecular dynamics**

   The best scored docking pose from the consensus docking protocol (ZINC1453, according to the ODDT Vina score)
   is used as input for the Molecular dynamics simulation example. To do so, we used Desmond, from Schr√∂dinger.
   We used this commercial software because of the advanced trajectory analysis and the automatic ligand
   parametrization they provide.

   - System preparation: the docked molecule (together with the receptor) is surrounded by a water box
     (with 5A buffer) with the SPC water model. Na+ and Cl- are added to reach 0.15M concentration and
     neutralizing the system. S-OPLS main force field is used to parametrize the system.
   - Simulation: the prepared system is simulated in this protocol using Desmond. First, the system is
     minimized and equilibrated following the default Desmond procedure. Then, a small production simulation
     is executed, enlarging the trajectory with 24ps of unrestricted simulations.
   - Production simulation: a second simulation protocol is executed to generate a larger production simulation
     of 5000ps of unrestricted simulation at native conditions, generating a trajectory that could be analyzed.

2) Structural ROIs definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Scipion project also includes several examples on how to determine the structural ROIs discussed in the paper.

.. figure:: images/subworkflow2.png
   :alt: rois workflow

1) **Manual definition**

We show a manual structural ROI definition in the 4ERF-A structure based on the area of its own ligand.

2) **Mapping from sequence ROIs**

Similarly to structural ROIs, Scipion-chem includes several ways to define Regions Of Interest over sequences. In this
example, we manually define two sequence ROIs on residues 1-4 and 22-25, which are then mapped to the structure in
order to define structural ROIs.

3) **Based on target characteristics**

As explained in the paper, another option to define structural ROIs is based on target characteristics. In this
example, the SASA (Solvent-Accessible Surface Area) is calculated over the 4ERF-A structure. From it, a protocol
extract the sequence ROIs containing higher values of SASA, and these are mapped to structural ROIs.

4) **Predicted pockets**

From the previous subworkflow, we have already shown an example of how structural ROIs can be defined using programs
that predict these protein concavities we call pockets.

3) Pharmacophore-based workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in the paper, Scipion-chem includes some features to perform pharmacophore-based virtual screening. In this
project, an example is shown.

.. figure:: images/subworkflow3.png
   :alt: pharmacophore workflow

To do so, the actual ligand of 4ERF is first extracted and a pharmacophore is generated from it. This resulting
pharmacophore is slightly modified to be more flexible using another Scipion-chem protocol, and this modified
pharmacophore is finally used as a filter for out set of 4 small molecules. In this example, as the pharmacophore
features are built using RDKit, we prepared the small molecules using RDKit too. The position of ZINC1099, fitted into
the pharmacophore, is shown in the figure of the paper related to this section.

We prepared the molecules using RDKit because, unfortunately, the full
interoperability is not yet achieved in Scipion-chem, and this is an example of it. Sometimes, small molecules
prepared with OpenBabel would not be parsed properly with RDKit and the protocols would fail.

4) Molecular dynamics (MD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, this demo project also includes several examples of molecular dynamics simulations.

.. figure:: images/subworkflow4.png
   :alt: md workflow

1) **On a docked molecule**

As described in the "Main VDS workflow" section, a molecular dynamics simulation is
performed using Desmond over the most promising docked molecule.

2) **On the original ligand**

The project includes an example the performs a MD simulation on the actual ligand of
4ERF (OR3) together with its receptor. This simulation is again performed on Desmond, since MD simulations with ligands
are not yet supported in gromacs or amber (they will hopefully come soon).

3) **Only on the receptor**

Finally, a MD simulation is performed on the receptor only, this time using Gromacs. As for
the previous cases, a first protocol is used to define the system, with the water box, ions and force fields; and a
second protocol actually executes the simulation, which can be visualized using PyMol or VMD (recommended). Moreover,
several Gromacs trajectory analysis can be executed from the Scipion GUI in the Analyze results option.

Note that the receptor file used for this subworkflow comes from a local file (4erf_prepared.pdb, included in this
repository). This file was obtained using PDBFixer, a software from OpenMM, using scipion-chem-scipionOpenmm, a plugin
not yet released. We use this because Gromacs needs a deep preparation of the input receptor in order to run.
